STL reading as vertices and faces
Creating the PlaneID and the ClusterID matrices
Caclulating connectivity (Consider sparse Matrix)

Loop over all vertices:
For the current vertex find neighborhood vertices
Calculating dissimilarity (Consider sparse matrix)
Using closest two points create a plane
Assing all points layaing in that plane to it

Loop over all vertices:
For the current vertex find the closest vertex that wasn't assigned to a cluster and isn't too far and assign it to current cluster and consider it as the current vertex
